# VGPSSM
Variational Gaussian Process State-Space Models

This is an attempt at making a Matlab toolbox based on the research code I wrote for the 2014 NIPS paper: [Variational Gaussian Process State-Space Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5375-variational-gaussian-process-state-space-models.pdf).

Unfortunately I did not have time to add much functionality to the toolbox and I am currently not able to offer any support.

To run the code:

 * Make sure you have the GPML toolbox on your Matlab path

 * Run test_script1d.m to see an example of the options and calling syntax.
